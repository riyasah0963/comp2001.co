CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

In most jurisdictions worldwide, creators and subsequent owners (referred to as “owners”) are automatically granted exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (as defined below) upon creating an original work of authorship and/or a database (each referred to as a “Work”).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish these rights to their Work to contribute to a commons of creative, cultural, and scientific works (“Commons”). This allows the public to freely use, modify, incorporate, reuse, and distribute the Work without fear of infringement claims. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideals of a free culture, foster creativity, gain reputation, or increase the distribution of their Work through the efforts of others.

With these motivations and without expecting compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”) voluntarily applies CC0 to the Work, thereby distributing it under its terms. The Affirmer does so with full knowledge of their Copyright and Related Rights and the legal implications of CC0.

1. Copyright and Related Rights

A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by various rights, including:

i. Rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate the Work;

ii. Moral rights retained by the original author(s) or performer(s);

iii. Publicity and privacy rights related to a person’s image or likeness depicted in the Work;

iv. Rights protecting against unfair competition regarding the Work, subject to limitations in Section 4(a);

v. Rights to extract, disseminate, use, and reuse data in the Work;

vi. Database rights, such as those under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament, and any national implementations;

vii. Other equivalent or corresponding rights worldwide based on applicable law or treaties.

2. Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Affirmer irrevocably waives, abandons, and surrenders all their Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, for the benefit of the public. This Waiver applies worldwide, for the maximum duration allowed by law, across all media, for any purpose, including commercial use. This Waiver is intended to be irrevocable, ensuring public enjoyment of the Work as intended by the Affirmer.

3. Public License Fallback

If any part of the Waiver is deemed invalid under applicable law, the Affirmer grants a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise their Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. This License applies globally, for the maximum duration permitted, across all media, for any purpose, including commercial use. The License takes effect from the date CC0 was applied. If any part of the License is invalid, the remainder remains effective, and the Affirmer will not exercise any remaining rights contrary to this Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers

a. No trademark or patent rights held by the Affirmer are affected by this document.

b. The Work is offered “as-is,” with no warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

c. The Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing any third-party rights or obtaining necessary consents for the use of the Work.

d. Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no obligations regarding this CC0 or the Work’s use.
